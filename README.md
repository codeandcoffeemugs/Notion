# Idea = CodeIgniter + stuff to make ideas easier to prototype

I built this with [John Mangino](http://twitter.com/johnmangino). More to follow.

It's a prototyping platform for PHP developers.

## Stuff that lives in Idea

Idea is built on top of a lot of great projects. Here's a list:

* [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com) 1.7.3 - the best Web framework I've ever used: nothing gets out of your way like CodeIgniter
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) - if you're gonna do HTML5, get a head start, thanks to [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/)
* [SimpleTest](http://www.simpletest.org) 1.0.1 - unit testing for PHP

Great features that live in the box:

* Highly-optimized functions for reading/writing global options - Thanks in large part to the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) codebase
* A generic caching mechanism that stores data in databases or memcached
* A command line interface - Execute controller actions and run unit test cases from the command line
